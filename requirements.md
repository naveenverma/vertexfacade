1. The name of the company is Vertex Facade Services. A child company of VERTEX AERIAL SYSTEMS.
1) One-page website — structure & content (high level)

Goal: Landing page that converts both customers (building managers / facility managers / builders) and investors. Fast load, mobile-first, SEO optimized, accessible.

Sections (order, mobile-optimized stack):

Header (sticky): logo, phone, “Get Quote” CTA, investor CTA (“Investor Pack”).

Hero (full-bleed): headline, sub-head, 2 CTAs (Get Quote / Request Demo), high-impact drone-in-action background video or hero image, trust logos (partners / pilots / DGCA compliance).

Problem snapshot: pain points (scaffolding cost, danger, downtime).

Solution snapshot: your drone fleet — capabilities and benefits (speed, cost, safety) with 3 quick stats (e.g., “Up to 80% savings vs lifts” — sourced claim).

How it works — visual 4-step graphic (Planning → Permits & Safety → Aerial Clean/Paint → QA & Handover). (See graphics spec below.)

Services & Packages (detailed tiers + pricing bands).

Tech & safety (drone specs, payloads, battery time, pilot training, Digital Sky & UIN requirements for India).

Case studies / project calculator (interactive: enter floors/area → estimate time & cost).

Investor pitch summary (market, model, unit economics, ask).

Team & partners (pilots, insurance, local partners).

Contact / Quote form + footer (structured data, sitemap links, social proof, privacy).

2) Suggested hero copy + microcopy (SEO-minded)

SEO focus keywords to seed: drone building cleaning, high-rise facade cleaning Chandigarh, drone painting services Delhi NCR, drone facade inspection India, drone maintenance services.

Hero (H1): "Safe. Fast. Cost-Effective High-Rise Cleaning & Painting — By Drone."
Subhead: "Cut scaffolding costs, remove risks, and complete jobs up to 4× faster. Servicing Chandigarh • Punjab • Haryana • Delhi NCR."
Primary CTA: "Get a Free Quote" — secondary CTA: "Request Pilot Demo"

Meta title (example): Drone Building Cleaning & Painting | Chandigarh • Delhi NCR — [CompanyName]
Meta description: Modern drone cleaning & painting for high-rise buildings. Save on lifts & labor — DGCA-compliant pilots, trained technicians, insurance & local permits. Free site survey.

JSON-LD (structured data): Include Organization, Service, LocalBusiness, FAQ schema (I’ll include a full JSON-LD snippet in the AI prompt below).

3) “How it works” — planning & strategy (with graphics)

Goal: show end-to-end process so investors see ops maturity and customers see clarity.

4-tile graphic (horizontal on desktop, stacked on mobile). Each tile includes an icon, 1-line title, 2-line description, and a small status badge.

Tile 1 — Plan & Survey

Visual: drone orthophoto + overlay grid (SVG map tiles).

Copy: "Remote LiDAR / photogrammetry scan → building asset map, material & paint spec → risk assessment & work plan."

Data: show lead times for permits and site surveys (e.g., 48–72 hours initial survey).

Tile 2 — Permits, Safety & Mobilization

Visual: checklist + Digital Sky UIN card (mock).

Copy: "Apply for Digital Sky flight authorizations, municipal/no-fly checks, local police & HOA notifications; set up safety exclusion zones and spotters."

Regulatory note: DGCA / Digital Sky registration & UIN needed for commercial flights in India.

Tile 3 — Drone Operation: Clean or Paint

Visual: split animation — left: drone spraying cleaning solution & rotating brush; right: drone and stabilizer applying paint with controlled nozzle.

Copy: "Autonomous flight path + manual pilot oversight. Payloads: cleaning pump (low/high pressure), paint sprayer with swath control. Continuous FPV & telemetry; live QA video feed to client."

Ops KPIs: coverage m²/min, battery swaps, crew size (2-3), downtime.

Tile 4 — QA, Finish & Handover

Visual: side-by-side before/after photos, checklist ticked.

Copy: "Automated inspection & hi-res photo report, QA sign-off, maintenance schedule & warranty registry."

Graphic assets to generate:

SVG flowchart for the 4 steps (mobile-friendly).

Interactive map overlay (HTML/CSS + small JS) showing permitted flight zones and service radius (Chandigarh + 100 km).

4) Service packages (market-researched and practical)

I created three tiers: Starter (B2C/building managers), Pro (B2B recurring maintenance), Enterprise (Large buildings / developers / painting projects). Prices are starting bands (INR) — adjust per local cost and site complexity.

Note: pricing below is an operational estimate (equipment, crew, consumables, permits, insurance). Final quotes should be site-survey based.

Starter — “Drone Clean” (single job)

What's included: exterior window cleaning for up to 6 floors OR facade spot cleaning; 1 pilot + 1 technician; pre-flight survey; before/after photos.

Turnaround: 1–2 days.

Price: ₹25,000 – ₹70,000 per job (depends on height & surface area).

Pro — “Maintenance Plan” (recurring)

What's included: quarterly cleaning for 7–15 floor buildings; priority booking; automated inspection report; minor touch-up (small paint touch-ups).

Team: 2 pilots, spare batteries, on-call engineer.

Price: ₹70,000 – ₹2,50,000 per quarter depending on building size & frequency.

Enterprise — “Full Facade Repaint / Restoration”

What's included: full-surface preparatory cleaning, paint specification, color matching, multi-coat paint application via drone + ground finishing for edges; scaffold-free option; long-term warranty.

Time: project-based (weeks).

Price: ₹5 Lakh – ₹50 Lakh+ (based on façade area, complexity, scaffolding avoided).

Value props and savings claim: Market literature and supplier claims show up to 80% cost savings vs traditional lift/scaffold methods and faster ROI for operators of Sherpa-type drones. Use these figures carefully in marketing with “up to” language and a source link.

5) Operations & Compliance (India specifics)

Register each aircraft on Digital Sky, obtain UIN & follow zone permissions; pilots must meet DGCA/recognized training school standards.

Insurance: commercial liability + third-party property damage; include proof of coverage on quotes.

Local permissions: municipal / police / HOA notices for densely populated Chandigarh/Delhi areas; some “red zones” or proximity to airports restrict operations — check Digital Sky maps per job.

Training: Provide Sherpa-style online + hands-on training for pilots (many suppliers include online courses for purchasers).

6) Investor pitch section (concise bullets to include on page)

Use a compact “Investor Snapshot” card with downloadable deck.

Key bullets (one-liners + metrics):

Problem: Traditional facade work is slow, hazardous & capital-heavy.

Solution: Drone fleet + payloads for cleaning & painting — lower labor & equipment costs, faster turnaround.

Market: Large residential & commercial building pipeline across NCR & Punjab; recurring maintenance contracts yield stable revenue.

Unit economics example: Average 12-floor job revenue ₹X, gross margin Y% (show project calculator).

Moat: Pilot network, local permissions/insurances, predictive maintenance data (inspection → recurring contracts).

Ask: Seed ₹2–5 Crore for fleet (5–10 drones), local pilots, training, insurance, and GTM; projected break-even after N months (show conservative scenario).
(Include a downloadable PDF investor deck CTA.)

7) On-page SEO & technical details (must-have)

Use semantic HTML (H1 once, H2 for sections).

Fast images: WebP, lazy loading.

Core Web Vitals: inline critical CSS for hero, defer JS.

Structured data: Organization, Service, LocalBusiness, FAQ, HowTo. (I include JSON-LD in the AI prompt.)

Local SEO: create service location pages or anchor links for Chandigarh, Panchkula, Mohali, Gurgaon, Faridabad.

Blog ideas (SEO): “How drones reduce façade maintenance costs,” “DGCA permits for commercial drone operations in Delhi,” “Case study: repainting without scaffold” — publish regularly.

8) Visual & UI suggestions (modern, investor-friendly)

Color palette: dark slate + high-contrast accent (safety orange or teal).

Typography: Inter or Poppins, bold H1, readable body.

Components: sticky CTA, project estimator widget, split before/after carousel, investor download modal, testimonial slider.

Graphics to generate:

Hero drone-in-action loop (10–15s, muted).

4-step SVG workflow (interactive).

KPI counters with animated numbers (jobs, m² cleaned, ROI%).

Case study visuals: interactive map + timeline.

9) Copy snippets & micro-sections (ready to drop in HTML)

(Include short ones — you can paste directly into the page template.)

Problem bullets:

“Scaffolding: Expensive, slow, and intrusive.”

“Manual rope access: Risky and requires multiple permits.”

“Downtime: Business disruption and tenant complaints.”

Benefits bullets:

“No scaffolding — faster jobs, less disturbance.”

“DGCA-compliant pilots and insured operations.”

“High-resolution inspection reports with every job.”

FAQ examples (include JSON-LD too):

Q: Are drone painting operations safe?

A: Yes — flights are pilot-supervised, we maintain exclusion zones, use non-flammable paint formulations, and carry full liabilty insurance.

Q: Do you need permission to fly in my area?

A: We handle Digital Sky filings and local permissions as part of every project.

(These FAQs map to the web’s FAQ schema.)

10) JSON-LD snippet (basic; include in page head)

Include this in the AI prompt; sample (shortened here — full in prompt below).
